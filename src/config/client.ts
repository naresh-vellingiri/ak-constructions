 *
 * Only the combined rate is AK's actual published figure — it is the same
 * ₹1,899 shown in the hero. **The other two have to come from Balaji.** A
 * plausible-looking number invented here is a price a customer reads, believes,
 * and plans a budget around, so it stays null until he supplies it.
 *
 * Note the combined rate currently undercuts the cheapest published
 * construction package (₹2,499, see /admin/packages). That contradiction is
 * Balaji's to resolve on the commercial side — do not paper over it by guessing
 * a construction-only rate here.
